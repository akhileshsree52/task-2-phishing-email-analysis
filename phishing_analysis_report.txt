Phishing Email Analysis Report

1. Sender Address Analysis:
The email claims to be from Payoneer but originates from a third-party domain (alerting-services.com), indicating sender spoofing.

2. Urgent Language:
The email uses urgency and time pressure by stating the payment will be returned within 24 hours unless action is taken.

5. Lack of Personalization:
The email does not address the recipient by name, which is common in mass phishing campaigns.

6. False Legitimacy Indicators:
The presence of a legal disclaimer is intended to make the email appear legitimate.

Conclusion:
The email contains multiple phishing indicators and is a malicious attempt to steal user credentials.
